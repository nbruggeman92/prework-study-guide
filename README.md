# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was designed to keep my thoughts organized as I learned new things about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I created this project to help other new boot camp students through the course prework. This project doesn't necessarily solve any problems but it condenses a lot of what I learned in my own prework into something that is much easier to read. I learned many new things about different programming languages that I will be able to put to work in this boot camp as well as my professional future.

Each section of this study guide contains notes that I recorded for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. DevTools can be opened from the webpage to suggest a topic that we can study first and will list all of the topics we learned about.
